# Design Patterns Journal

Welcome to my Design Patterns Journal! This repository is a personal project where I document and implement various design patterns that I have learned. Each design pattern is organized in its own folder, containing the relevant code and documentation.

## Introduction

This project serves as a learning journal for design patterns. Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. By studying and implementing these patterns, I aim to deepen my understanding of best practices in software design.

## Design Patterns

Below is a list of the design patterns documented in this repository. Each pattern has its own folder containing the implementation and relevant explanations.

### Command Bus

The [Command Bus](./command_bus) pattern is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations. It also provides support for undoable operations.
